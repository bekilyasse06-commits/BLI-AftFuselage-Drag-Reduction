BLI Aft-Fuselage Drag Reduction Project

Project Overview
This project investigates a novel Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI) system integrated into the aft fuselage of a commercial aircraft, combined with strategically placed Vortex Generators (VGs), to reduce wake drag and improve fuel efficiency. The system targets sustainable aviation goals by minimizing aerodynamic losses through active flow control and propulsion-airframe integration.

Key Features :
Aft-mounted BLI fan positioned behind empennage surfaces

Vortex generator array placed ahead of tail control surfaces

Multi-disciplinary approach: aerodynamics, propulsion, controls, structures

CFD validation with OpenFOAM/SU2

Performance trade studies (drag reduction vs. weight penalty)

Smart control strategy for adaptive VG deployment and fan operation

Objectives :
Quantify potential drag reduction and fuel savings through BLI + VG integration

Develop optimized VG geometry and placement for boundary layer control

Analyze BLI fan performance under distorted inflow conditions

Create a validated aerodynamic model suitable for concept demonstration

Build a compelling technical portfolio for academic/research applications

Technical Stack :
CAD: OpenVSP / Fusion 360

CFD: OpenFOAM / SU2 / SimScale

Programming: Python (scientific computing, analysis, automation)

Controls: MATLAB/Simulink or Python-based control simulations

Documentation: LaTeX, Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks
